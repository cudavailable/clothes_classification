# clothes_classification
**This is my first project related to deep learning and computer vision. The task is to implement a complete multi-label classification about clothes.**

Task description:
- clothes color classification
- clothes type classification

File description
- clothes :  Dataset including images and a meta.json file which can give you more details.
- model.py : Model definition using a pretrained Resnet to implement multi-task learning framework.
- sample.py : A sample class.
- data_processing.py : Data sampling, training & testing datasets building, image processing (all of them are preparations for model training & testing).
- train.py : Model training & testing.
- main.py : Overall workflow.
- myTutorial7.ipynb : A tutorial which I have personally practiced.

If you are looking forward to getting started with computer vision, I highly recommend Prof. Wei's tutorials which really help me a lot.
